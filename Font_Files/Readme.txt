Photonsters alternative fonts for CBD-based printers

https://github.com/Photonsters/photon-ui-mods

The font included in these files is only used to display file names and text box messages.
Other UI items as elapsed/remaining time, number of layers, FW version or LCD test text won't be affected.
Only latin characters are modified. A sample BMP file is available to check font differences.


Installation instructions. 
__________________________

Copy the desired files to a good tested USB stick.

Insert USB stick into your printer.

Via touchscreen, select the xxxxxx_FontFile.bin file and "print" the file.

Wait for the end of print message, press OK.

That's it. The new font will automatically be used in text box messages and file names.

Note: As the Font File makes no changes to the firmware or configurations, you do NOT need to relevel or reset Z=0.
