https://github.com/Photonsters/photon-ui-mods

Installation instructions. 
__________________________

Extract the files to a good tested USB stick.

Insert USB stick into your printer.

Via touchscreen, select the PHCNET_UI_2_8_xxxxxx.logo file and "print" the file.

Wait for the beeps, press OK.

Now select the PHCNET_UI_2_8_xxxxxx.bin file and "print" it.

Wait for the beeps. Press OK.

That's it. You've enabled the new UI mod (and depending on your firmware, the hidden network features).

Note: As the UI mod makes no changes to the firmware or configurations, you do not need to relevel or reset Z=0.



Configuring the Network (unlocked hidden menu)
_______________________

If your firmware version allows it, and you wish to use the network feature, continue with the following steps:

Via the touchscreen, access the network menu that was enabled by this PHCN-UI mod.

Switch the device to ethernet (Wireless/Ethernet button).

Enable the network (ON/OFF button).

Open the back access panel of your machine and connect a network cable to your switch or router.

The machine should acquire an IP address and show it on the touchscreen.

Using Chitubox v1.4.0 (or newer), you may now select the IP address of your Photon and send print files over or start a remote print.
