# Photonsters Official UI Mod 
This is the official UI (User Interface) modification for the original Anycubic Photon Classic 3D printers. 

The default UI menu is hard to read on the small 2.8" touchscreen, compounded by a poor choice of cyan blue on white lettering. This UI mod aims to provide a more legible and better user experience. 

This mod may also be deployed for all other Chitu-CBD mainboard based LCD printers with a 2.8" touchscreen. 

**Note that the Photon-S cannot use this UI mod because it is based on a completely different mainboard.** 

### High Contrast (HC) UI Mod

The mod provides a clean and clear high contrast UI menu for the original Photon and other Chitu-CBD mainboard based printers with a 2.8" touchscreen. 

All icons are now in black & white, with black backgrounds for the firmware generated cyan coloured text. 

This mod also enables a hidden menu (depending on firmware version) that will allow users to network their printers via the embedded ethernet port on the machine mainboard.

The mod package includes a copy of the default (original) UI. You may revert if you decide that this mod is not for you.
